## *No Longer Human*, Osamu Dazai
You’ve been called a lot of things, but “diligent” is not one of them. You refuse to spend money on a haircut, but you’ll spend three hours doing a cost-benefit analysis of your options on SpotHero. You had a meltdown at Benihana’s after your MPH graduation, but that was the old you. There was definitely a black box theatre phase. You’re active on MySpace. 


## *Coin Locker Babies*, Ryu Murakami
It’s never quite enough, is it?  You run your Roomba (Luca) 7 times per day and you love a good Fiverr outsource. Your aunt calls you “brilliant;” your junior prom date calls you “troubling.” You creep your friend’s refrigerators looking for Uncrustables and a few other things that must be kept below room temperature. Sure you “play” the guitar. 


## *The Bullfight*, Yashushi Inoue
Your bachelor party theme was “Shinto Prayer Pavillions.” You have a blog for your home office setup, and you restrict your Google searches for exercise advice to .edu domains. Your Kinko’s account has been sent to collections; thanks to you, though, everything runs smoothly at home. Sure you have “mommy issues” — who doesn’t?! Hahaha.

## *A Personal Matter*, Kenzaburo Oe
A lot of unspoken family tensions. When’s the last time you had a single coherent though? Instead, you make a lot of long, impractical lists (like this one). Your fantasy is to scrub a red ‘65 Ford Thunderbird squeaky clean in your driveway at like 5 AM. You’re not really sure how many siblings you have. You don’t trust the valet. 


## *The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea*, Yukio Mishima
Others find you entertaining enough; think Eric from South Park meets Larry David (but less funny). You say you love yoga, but this is a lie; you say you’re proud of who you’ve become (this is also a lie). You drive your four wheeler to Planet Fitness and then straight to Revere Tan on the way back to counter the creatine comedown.


## *Snow Country*, Yasunari Kawabata
You’re actually completely fine; you’re just being dramatic.

## *Kangaroo Notebook*, Kobo Abe
You, on the other hand, are really, really, really not fine.
