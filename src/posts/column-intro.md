My school's newspaper, The Vangaurd, takes 4-5 juniors every spring to be columnists for a year. 

For 2021-22 Vangaurd issue, the editorial board choose me as one of the columnists!

It is titled **Nine Lives** which is part narrative, part humor, part advice, and part diary.

As they come out, I will be posting them on this website; I hope you enjoy reading them!
