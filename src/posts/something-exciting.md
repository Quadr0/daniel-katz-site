I love books, but I definitely have a type. The books I’m faithful to all have something I can best describe as a pulse; I feel like I can flip up the words and see the meanings they’re meant to deliver to me. They’re books that transgress boundaries between high and low culture; they deal with pretentious matters very unpretentiously. They’re dramatic but not over the top; they’re abrasive, yet stylish. The way they nonchalantly roll out the moments that change everything feels unnatural, supernatural and totally natural, all at once. 

A perfect example: A Personal Matter by Kenzaburo Oe, a semi-autobiography about a man reckoning with having a disabled son, wherein Oe lays out what feel (to me) like the original blueprints of fear and hope. His lyrical diction stands orthogonal to the characters’ awful thoughts, and it all adds up to a story that has little to do with its plot summary. When I first read A Personal Matter, I felt like I’d been put through the emotional equivalent of a garbage compactor. I keep re-reading it. 

The books I love light my brain on fire to the point where I take long walks home. I’ve found a higher concentration of them in 20th century Japanese literature; maybe it’s something about being raised to believe your emperor is a demi-god and then finding out your village friend can perfectly emulate his voice (alright, this may be too obscure of a reference). But they come in many different packages. I think I love them because they don’t avoid the reality of adult choices: of there being few straight answers and no guarantees, and of time’s tendency to separate us from the version of ourselves we last recognized. They’re not inspiring in the traditional sense; they’re just real. That’s exciting.
